# H2MM Simulation Tools

This repository provides a suite of Jupyter notebooks for simulating and analyzing smFRET dynamics. The tools focus on trajectory generation, state exchange modeling, and dye blinking effects, providing robust solutions for studying single-molecule FRET systems.

## Notebooks Overview

1. Trajectory Simulation
Simulates smFRET trajectories using PyBroMo based on defined parameters, offering insights into molecular dynamics over time.

2. PIE Timestamps Simulation
Generates timestamps for Pulsed Interleaved Excitation (PIE) experiments, providing a framework for analyzing photon arrival events.

3. Dynamic State Exchange Simulation
Simulates state exchange dynamics to explore transitions between molecular states, focusing on energy transfer efficiency.

4. Blinking Simulation
Models dye blinking effects in smFRET experiments, enabling accurate artifact correction and improved data interpretation.
